- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dylanft
- Iâ€™m building decentralized finance primitives on Bitcoin and Stacks to scale the economy around the best form of money and to replace malicious middlemen with secure smart contracts. Specifically, I'm working on BitFlow (https://www.bitflow.finance/) -- the best trading and earning UX for assets on Bitcoin.
- Learn more about Stacks here: https://github.com/stacks-network  ,  https://stacks.co/

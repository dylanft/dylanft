- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dylanft
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m building a better internet centered around Bitcoin where individuals have ownership of their money and data using the Stacks ecosystem (@blockstack https://stacks.co/)
- I'm focused on designing a working capital optimization service that let's users put their L1 Bitcoin to work in a trustless manner for USD stablecoin loans to optimize supply chain finance.

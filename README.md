- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dylanft
- Iâ€™m building Bitcoin centric products where individuals have ownership of their money and data via the Stacks ecosystem. Specifically, I'm working on BitFlow (https://www.bitflow.finance/) which offers DeFi Protocols for People Who Self-Custody Bitcoin Savings
- Learn more about Stacks here: https://github.com/stacks-network  ,  https://stacks.co/ 
- What problem is BitFlow solving?
  - People are trying to grow their savings and earn a yield with Bitcoin, but centralized solutions have proven they can't be trusted with that money (take Celsius, for example). BitFlow is a decentralized stable swap protocol where your stablecoins and native BTC savings work together in harmony to compound your wealth. Our solution is powered by Clarity and Discreet Log Contracts so that no one ever has control of your Bitcoin. With BitFlow's design, people looking to safely grow their savings with native Bitcoin finally have an advantage in DeFi.

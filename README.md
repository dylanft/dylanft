- 👋 Hi, I’m @dylanft
- 👀 I’m building a better internet on Bitcoin where individuals have ownership of their money and data using the Stacks ecosystem (@blockstack https://stacks.co/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning @clarity-lang, which brings smart contracts to Bitcoin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with ...
  - Zoo Miami & The Ron Magill Conservation Endowment to accept donations from $MIA holders (MiamiCoin https://www.citycoins.co/miamicoin). I'm hopeful that MiamiCoin will nudge the local government to consider new models of civic engagement and reduce the city treasury's dependence on municipal bonds.
  - an experienced front-end developer to implement my design for a working capital optimization service that empowers businesses of all sizes to put their Bitcoin savings to work as collateral in a trust-less manner and achieve greater health in their supply chain finances.
